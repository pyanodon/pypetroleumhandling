TODO: continue sorting recipes and need to still handle all distillates


naphtha is used for gasoline and made into isoprene which is used for natural rubber

Pyrolysis residual oils are tarlike byproducts
of the steam cracking of naphtha and gas oil to
produce alkenes

with pyht active add pitch to graphite rods


gasoline is an aromtic hydrocarbon mix.
the best gasoline is heavy on the alkanes

naphthalene is an aromatic but makes a low grade "straight run" gasoline like naphtha. low grade == low output for the recipes


add ammonia to syngas recipe in whichever mod adds ammonia
check for e hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide in later mods
otherwise use acidgas
